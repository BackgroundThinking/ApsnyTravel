# ApsnyTravel

A boutique travel booking platform for **Alexander**, a private guide specializing in exclusive tours and VIP transfers across Sochi, Krasnaya Polyana, and Abkhazia.

## Overview

ApsnyTravel serves as the digital storefront for a personal guide business. Unlike mass-market aggregators, this application focuses on a curated selection of author's tours and transfers, emphasizing quality, comfort, and authentic experiences without tourist traps.

The platform allows users to:
- Explore detailed itineraries for regions like Abkhazia ("Country of Soul") and the Olympic Coast.
- View high-quality photo galleries and read real client reviews.
- Request bookings via a secure, validated form.

## Key Features

- **Curated Catalog:** Browse tours by region (Sochi, Abkhazia, Krasnaya Polyana) or type (Tour, Transfer, Photo-tour).
- **Rich Detail Pages:** Deep dive into tour programs with Markdown-rendered descriptions and itineraries (`pages/TourDetail.tsx`).
- **Secure Booking Flow:** Integrated booking form with real-time validation using **Zod** and **React Hook Form**.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully mobile-optimized UI built with **Tailwind CSS**.
- **Mock-First Development:** Runs seamlessly without a backend in development mode, simulating network latency for realistic UX testing.

## Architecture & Tech Stack

This project is a modern Single Page Application (SPA) built for performance and maintainability.

- **Frontend Framework:** React 19 + TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Routing:** React Router 7
- **Data Fetching:** TanStack Query v5 (React Query)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 3
- **Validation:** Zod + React Hook Form

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- npm (v9+ recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BackgroundThinking/ApsnyTravel.git
   cd ApsnyTravel
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Configuration

The application uses Vite's environment variable system. Create a `.env` file in the root directory to override defaults.

| Variable | Description | Default / Example |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| `VITE_API_URL` | Base URL for the backend API. If omitted, the app uses internal mock data. | `https://api.apsnytravel.ru` |
| `VITE_BOOKING_ENDPOINT` | Webhook or API endpoint for form submissions. **Required for production.** | `https://api.apsnytravel.ru/book` |

> **Note:** In development, if `VITE_BOOKING_ENDPOINT` is not set, the booking form will simulate a successful submission after a delay.

## Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Starts the development server with HMR. |
| `npm run build` | Builds the app for production. |
| `npm run preview` | Locally previews the production build. |
| `npm run lint` | Runs ESLint to catch code quality issues. |
| `npm run format` | Formats code using Prettier. |
| `npm test` | Runs unit tests via Vitest. |

## Deployment

### Recommended: Vercel

This repository includes a `vercel.json` configuration file specifically designed for Vercel deployment. It handles Single Page Application (SPA) rewrites automatically.

1. Push your code to a Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
2. Import the project into Vercel.
3. Add the `VITE_BOOKING_ENDPOINT` environment variable in the Vercel dashboard.
4. Deploy.

### Alternative Static Hosting

You can deploy the `dist` folder (generated by `npm run build`) to any static hosting service (Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, AWS S3/CloudFront).

**Important:** You must configure your host to rewrite all 404 requests to `index.html` so that React Router can handle deep linking.
